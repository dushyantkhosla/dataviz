About Us
========

PyViz is a collaboration between the maintainers of
`Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`_,
`HoloViews <http://holoviews.org>`_,
`GeoViews <http://geo.holoviews.org>`_,
`Datashader <https://github.com/bokeh/datashader>`_, and
`Param <https://github.com/ioam/param>`_, including
James A. Bednar, Philipp Rudiger, Jean-Luc Stevens, and Bryan Van de Ven.

The authors of all of these tools are working closely together to help
make them into a coherent solution to a wide range of Python
visualization problems, funded in part by 
`Anaconda, Inc. <http://anaconda.com>`_

The PyViz team thanks Brian Thomas at Washington State University for
donating the pyviz.org domain to the PyViz project.  If you are interested
in Brian's PyViz smart-home visualization tool, check out his
`paper <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5766889/>`_.

If you like PyViz, please `tweet <http://twitter.com>`_ a screenshot
of your latest creation, linking to ``pyviz.org`` and tagging it
``#PyViz`` along with any other library you relied on (``@HoloViews``,
``@Datashader``, ``@BokehPlots``, ``@Matplotlib``, etc.).
